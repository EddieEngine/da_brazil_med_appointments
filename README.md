Why do 20% of patients miss their scheduled appointments? In this project, we will be analyzing the problems associated with missed medical appointments using the `No-show appointments` dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd2e9a_noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016/noshowappointments-kagglev2-may-2016.csv&sa=D&ust=1532469042118000) and in particular we will be interested in trends amongst patients who miss medical appointments and how they differ from those that showed up.
